    A variety of things happened while sitting here waiting for the Tylenol to kick in after a long week. For example.
    <BR>
- I realized just how nice my phone looks when it's not turned down to zero brightness. It looks, like, really good. Like, you can see it without squinting, and the letters don't all look the same. And it also doesn't hurt to read it. Like, "technology is beautiful, man" moment. I've stared at it writing this for like another good 45 minutes and still, it's like nice to look at. Shit, the "Apple snob" attitude finally got it's evil hooks into me. That took a while. Anyway.

- The next moment is when I am sitting here, reading on my phone with a neck cramp when I realized I had my iPad literally next to me on the arm of my chair. I stared at it for a moment so that it could feel the contempt I felt for it being Right next to me. Like, I wouldn't even need to stretch my arm to get it. Growling eyes. That felt good. Anyway.

- I was reading an article on organizers. It was really good, and I secretly wished to find the organizers that I picked for myself on the list, for a smug sense of satisfaction. I needed to send the page to the iPad to continue reading it. For the neck, remember? Anyway I open the share button on my phone ready to contemplate which of the 15,000 ways I send this thing. Do I email it? Text it? Do I save it on the notes thing and send it? Thats when Airdrop picked up, and instantly shot the page to the iPad. The iPad lights up sitting on my lap. My articles on bag organizers, which I secretly wished to find my chosen bag organizers on. Open the share button, and hit the Airdrop and it lights up. So I sit there, stunned it was that easy for a good 4 or 5 seconds when it dawned on me that I accidently made my own iPad ad. Apple is fucking evil.
